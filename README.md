## Overview

Your Note is an AI-powered platform designed to help students understand their studies better by providing personalized learning support through advanced AI technologies.

##Installation

To install all the required dependencies for your project, you can use the following command:  

```bash
pip install streamlit streamlit-drawable-canvas pillow pandas groq gtts opencv-python pytesseract numpy
```

### **Additional Installation Notes:**
1. **Tesseract OCR (for PyTesseract)**  
   If you're using **PyTesseract** for text recognition, you also need to install **Tesseract-OCR** separately:  
   - **Windows**: Download and install it from [Tesseract GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). Then, add the path to your environment variables.
   - **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
     ```
   - **Mac (Homebrew)**:  
     ```bash
     brew install tesseract
     ```

2. **Verifying Installation**  
   After installing, you can check if everything is installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   python -c "import streamlit, pillow, pandas, groq, gtts, cv2, pytesseract, numpy; print('All dependencies installed successfully!')"
   ```
  Hereâ€™s a structured **README** section covering **Usage, Contributing, Related Projects, and Licensing** for your project:

## **Usage**  
This AI-powered study assistant helps students learn more effectively by leveraging AI for note analysis, test generation, and text-to-audio conversion.  

### **Features:**  
- **AI-Powered Study Assistant:** Upload or write study notes, and the AI will summarize key concepts, highlight knowledge gaps, and suggest improvements.  
- **Test Generation:** Automatically create multiple-choice and short-answer questions from notes for self-assessment.  
- **Text-to-Audio Conversion:** Convert study materials into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for auditory learners.  
- **Handwritten Note Recognition:** Upload handwritten notes, and the system will extract and analyze the text.  
- **Writable/Drawable Canvas:** A digital whiteboard where students can write or draw, with AI-powered feedback.  

### **Running the Project**  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit streamlit-drawable-canvas pillow pandas groq gtts opencv-python pytesseract numpy
   ```
2. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
   Replace `main.py` with the actual entry-point script of your project.
